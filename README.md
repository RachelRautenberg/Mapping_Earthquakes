# Mapping_Earthquakes
Mod 13

##Overview

For this project there was much time and effort spent learning mapping with leaftlet and mapbox.  d3, geoJSON, and js were utilized for completion.
There are many branches for this repository, a new branch was added each time a new feature was worked on.

##Notes for submission

At first look, the third map layer for deliverable three is not very distinct when looking at the full map.  See examples below of Streets layer and Outdoors layer.

Outdoors

Because of the similarities in the maps at this zoom level, the final presentation may appear to be lacking.  However, when we zoom in, as will be shared below, there is great land detail on the Outdoors layer.  Depending on the use and need of the mapped Earthquake data, the Outdoors layer could be quite useful for someone that desire to hone in to a very granular level as to what may be impacted by a local earthquake.  Or if you are a hiker, you may want to see how your planned path intersects with recent major earthquakes or even tectonic plates. Who knows maybe you are outdoorsy and earthquakey!  For those reasons, I decided to leave the Outdoors layer as my third layer.
